# Architecture decision log

Each entry: context, decision, consequences. New entries are appended at the
bottom. Never edit an accepted ADR — supersede it with a new one and link.

## ADR-001 — Standing pins are the source of truth

**Status:** accepted (2026-05).

**Context.** Bowling scoring can be modeled by storing pinfall counts
(`shot_1_pinfall: 7`), pin masks (bitmask of knocked-down pins), or
standing-pin arrays (`shot_1_pins_standing: [7, 10]`). 10th-frame bonus shots
in particular need to know what was *racked* before a shot so we can compute
"pins cleared this shot" correctly.

**Decision.** Store the pins that remain standing after each shot. Strikes
become `[]`; gutter balls become the full rack.

**Consequences.**
- The user taps the pins they see still standing; storage matches input
  directly.
- Frame-level booleans (`is_strike`, `is_spare`) are derived, not authoritative.
  Backup validation re-derives them on import so a hand-edited JSON can't lie.
- Adding a "pin carry / message-board diagram" feature later is free: the data
  is already there.

## ADR-002 — `snake_case` on the wire, `camelCase` in the UI

**Status:** accepted (2026-05).

**Context.** TypeScript convention prefers camelCase fields, but Dexie stores
whatever you give it and JSON backups are user-visible. Mixing both inside a
single record would mean a translation layer at every read/write.

**Decision.** Persistent fields on `Session`, `Game`, `Frame` and the backup
JSON use snake_case. UI-only state (component props, hooks, local variables)
uses camelCase.

**Consequences.**
- Backups exported now are forward-compatible with any future export target
  (sqlite mirror, csv export, http sync).
- Repository return types are the same shape as DB rows — no mapping layer.
- Hand-written test fixtures don't need a key-rename helper.

## ADR-003 — Backup import merges by content key, never by id

**Status:** accepted (2026-05). Supersedes the prior "trust imported id"
implementation in `services/backupRepository.ts`.

**Context.** Auto-increment IDs from one device collide with auto-increment
IDs on another. The earlier implementation silently overwrote a local row
when the imported row carried the same `id` — even if the two were unrelated
sessions in different alleys on different days.

**Decision.** On import, match rows by content:
- Sessions match on `(date + alley_name)`.
- Games match on `(session_id + game_number)` after sessions are resolved.
- Frames match on `(game_id + frame_number)` after games are resolved.

Imported ids are never replayed. If no content match exists, the row is
inserted with a fresh local id.

**Consequences.**
- Reimporting a backup twice is idempotent.
- A user can merge a backup from another device without clobbering their own
  data, even with overlapping ids.
- Two sessions at the same alley on the same date are treated as one session.
  This is the right call in practice — bowlers don't usually start two
  separate-tracked sessions on the same day at the same house — but worth
  knowing if the rare "two leagues, same day, same house" case comes up.

## ADR-004 — Mobile-first at iPhone 390x844

**Status:** accepted (2026-05).

**Context.** The product is a bowler holding a phone at the alley. Anything
that requires a desktop browser to be usable is a failure.

**Decision.** Every screen must render and be operable at 390x844 with no
horizontal page overflow. Desktop and tablet layouts are bonus. When a
layout decision favors one or the other, mobile wins.

**Consequences.**
- The scorecard renders as a 5x2 grid on `<sm` and a 10-cell row on `sm+`.
- Navigation lives at the bottom of the viewport on mobile (thumb reach) and
  in the top bar on `sm+`.
- New views must be tested at 390x844 (see verification section in the spec).
